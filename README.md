# React-APP-Google-Map-
I would like to complete a small task as listed below using React.

Create a web page which includes:






 A: A button to support user location acquisition from browser
 
 
 B: A module which allows user to input the name of a location. (Searching feature is triggered by both button click, and press enter key on the keyboard)
 
 
 C:Display the location on the map and add a marker to each searched location every time when the location is changed.
 
 
 D:A table with pagination to show all searched places:
 
 
    1, It displays a maximum of 10 records on each page
    
    
    2, A checkbox at the beginning of each row to allow user to select multiple records at the same time.
    
    
    3, A delete button on the top of it to delete all selected records as well as the marker on the map.  
    
    
 E:Display the time zone and local time of the latest searched location
